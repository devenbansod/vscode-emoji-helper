### Add ignore patterns

- This will disable this pattern to be matched for emojis for this VS Code session

### Autocomplete Emojis

- In a markdown document, if you want to type an emoji, press `Ctrl` + `Space` and you should see a list of emojis that you can use. Selecting anyone from the hover will add it to the document at the current cursor location.
